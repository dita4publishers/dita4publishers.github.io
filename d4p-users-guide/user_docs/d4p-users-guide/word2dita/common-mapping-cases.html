  <h1 class="title topictitle1">Common Style-to-Tag Mapping Cases</h1>
  
  
  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Describes how to map styles to tags for common cases</p>

    <p class="p">This section describes how to set up the mapping for different common cases.</p>

    <div class="p">But first some general tips:<ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">For paragraphs that map to topic components you must specify the
            <code>@topicZone</code> attribute as this attribute is used to group incoming
          paragraphs for further processing. If the <code>@topicZone</code> attribute is not
          specified a default of "body" is used. This is usually what you want but would be wrong if
          the paragraph should have gone in the map or topic prolog.</li>

        <li class="li">Paragraphs that contribute to the root topic or map metadata can go anywhere in the Word
          document because they go into a separate topic zone and therefore get plucked out of the
          input and put in the right place regardless of where they occur.</li>

        <li class="li">The <code>@level</code> attribute is what determines the hierarchical relationship
          among elements within the same output context, such as within the topic body.</li>

        <li class="li">You can specify either the style display name, using <code>@styleName</code> or the
          style ID, using <code>@styleId</code>. The style name is the display name that is used
          in the various Word style-related user interfaces. The style ID is the value specified in
          the underlying markup for paragraphs and character ranges. If you specify both style name
          and style ID on a mapping, the style name takes precedence. In general, the style name is
          more reliable as Word may change the style ID, for example, when using locale-specific
          versions of Word.</li>

        <li class="li">The "style ID" for Word styles is not the same as the display name of the style, but it
          is usually very similar. In most cases the style ID is the display name with all spaces
          and special character removed, e.g., the style with the display name "Heading 1" has the
          style ID "Heading1". If you happen to define two style names that differ only in their use
          of spaces, e.g., "Heading 1" and "Heading1", then the style ID of the second style defined
          will be something like "Heading10" so that the style ID is unique within the Word
          document. If you're not sure what the style ID is you can open the document.xml file from
          the DOCX Zip package and look for <code>&lt;w:pStyle&gt;</code> elementsâ€”the value of the
            <code>@w:val</code> attribute is the style ID.</li>

        <li class="li">The <code>@tagName</code> attribute always specifies the name of the <em class="ph i">primary</em>
          (most deeply nested) result element. The primary result may be surrounded by other
          elements as specified with other attributes, such as <code>@containerType</code>. The
          element named by <code>@tagName</code> is the element that will contain the text of the
          paragraph or character run being mapped, except in a few special cases, such as mapping to
          section elements.</li>

        <li class="li">The <code>@outputclass</code> attribute is helpful for applying further XSLT
          processing (particularly in finding appropriate elements) and for applying additional
          styling in an output (like in HTML where the <code>@outputclass</code> attribute
          becomes part of the generated class attribute that can be used with CSS).</li>

        <li class="li">A paragraph that generates a topic may also generate a map or submap and in that case
          will also generate a topicref to the topic (and a mapref to the submap if a submap is
          generated). This lets you generate trees of maps in addition to trees of topics. You can
          choose to generate a hierarchy of topics as separate topic documents with nested topicrefs
          or as a single XML document with a root topic and nested topics. </li>

      </ul>
</div>

    <p class="p">Finally, the design of the current style-to-tag mapping document evolved somewhat organically
      based on client requirements as they came up. There are aspects of it that are not necessarily
      logically consistent. I have started the process of designing a new style-to-tag mapping
      document type but it's on the back burner. But I would definitely welcome any suggestions for
      how to make the mapping markup clearer or easier to use.</p>

<div class="topic concept nested1" id="normal-paragraph-mapping">
    <h2 class="title topictitle2">Simple Paragraphs and Character Runs</h2>

    <div class="body conbody">
      <div class="p">For paragraphs that simply map directly to elements within the topic body with no required
        container elements the general mapping specification is:
        <pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;paragraphStyle styleName="Normal" tagName="p" topicZone="body" level="1"/&gt;</pre>
</div>

      <p class="p">Where the parts in italics are what you would change to match a specific Word paragraph
        style to a specific DITA output element.</p>

      <p class="p">This example maps a paragraph with the style name "Normal" to the DITA element
          <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.</p>

      <div class="p">Likewise, for character runs, you specify the style name and tag
        name:<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;characterStyle
  styleName="<em class="ph i">Heading 1 Char</em>"
  tagName="<em class="ph i">ph</em>"
  topicZone="body"
  level="1"
/&gt;</pre>
</div>

      <p class="p">You can specify <code>@containerType</code> on <code>&lt;characterStyle&gt;</code> in order to generate two levels of 
        containment, e.g., <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> within <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>. 
        You can also use the transform's "final fixup" mode to convert single elements like <code>&lt;bi&gt;</code> 
        into nested elements if you want. Note that the DITA for Publishers formatting domain
        includes elements for common combinations of bold, italic, and smallcaps, as well as other
        elements you might need.</p>

    </div>

  </div>

  <div class="topic concept nested1" id="headings">
    <h2 class="title topictitle2">Heading Paragraphs That Map to Topics</h2>

    <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">To map heading paragraphs to topics you specify the topic type and the markup details for
        the generated topic. The heading paragraph becomes the topic title and the other topic
        elements are generated automatically.</p>

      <div class="p">For example, to map the paragraph "Heading 1" to a concept topic you would use this mapping:<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;paragraphStyle styleName="Heading 1"
     structureType="topicTitle"
     tagName="title"
     level="1"&gt;
   &lt;topicrefProperties topicrefType="chapter"/&gt;
   &lt;topicProperties topicType="concept"
     bodyType="conbody"
     topicDoc="yes"
     format="concept"
   /&gt;
&lt;/paragraphStyle&gt;</pre>
</div>

      <p class="p">The structure type "topicTitle" indicates that this paragraph acts as a topic title, which
        means it will generate a new topic, either in a separate document or as a subtopic of a
        parent topic. In this case the value of the <code>@level</code> attribute ("1") indicates
        that this is a top-level topic.</p>

      <p class="p">The <code>@tagName</code> attribute defines the tagname to use for the topic's title
        element, "title" in this case (it would only be different from "title" if you were
        generating a specialized topic with a specialized topic title element).</p>

      <p class="p">The <code>@topicType</code> attribute specifies the tagname for the root element of the
        topic to be generated, "concept" in this case.</p>

      <p class="p">The <code>@bodyType</code> attribute specifies the tagname for the topic body element,
        "conbody" in this case.</p>

      <p class="p">The <code>@level</code> attribute indicates that this is a top-level topic and it would
        be subordinate only to a paragraph that specifies level zero, which is normally reserved for
        the paragraph that generates the root map or topic and should normally be the first
        unskipped paragraph in the Word document.</p>

      <p class="p">The <code>@topicDoc</code> attribute indicates that this topic should be put in a new
        document, which in turn implies the generation of a topicref to the generated document. The
        default is "no" so you must specify <code>@topicDoc</code> with a value of "yes" if you
        want the topic chunked out to a new file.</p>

      <p class="p">If you specify "yes" for <code>@topicDoc</code> then you must specify
          <code>@format</code>, which names an <code>&lt;output&gt;</code> element defined in the
        style-to-tag mapping document. The format value determines the public and system IDs to use
        for the generated topic document. You must also specify the <code>@topicrefType</code>
        attribute if process is generating a map in addition to topics.</p>

      <p class="p">If you specify "yes" for <code>@topicDoc</code> and the topic is not the root topic
        (meaning the primary result topic) then the style mapping should also generate a map so that
        there is a place to put a topicref to the generated topic document.</p>

      <p class="p">The <code>@topicrefType</code> attribute specifies the tagname to use for the topicref
        that will refer to the generated topic. In this case the topicref tagname is "chapter".</p>

      <p class="p">Mapping lower-level headings uses the same pattern, specifying the appropriate level, e.g.,
        level "2" for paragraph style Heading 2 and so on.</p>

    </div>

  </div>

  <div class="topic concept nested1" id="mapping-lists">
    <h2 class="title topictitle2">Mapping List Paragraphs (Generating Container Elements)</h2>

    <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">Lists are typical of elements that must be generated within the context of container
        elements, e.g. <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> within <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> or
        <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>.</p>

      <div class="p">To map list item paragraphs to DITA lists you map the paragraph to the appropriate list item element, e.g., <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> and then specify the name of the container element to wrap all adjacent list items in, specified using the <code>@containerType</code> attribute, like so:<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;paragraphStyle
  styleName="List Bullet"
  tagName="li"
  containerType="ul"
  level="1"
  topicZone="body"
/&gt;</pre>
</div>

      <p class="p">Here the tag name is "li", indicating that the paragraph content will be output in a
          <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element. The <code>@containerType</code> attribute names the
        tagname of the container element for the list item, <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> in this case. The
        value "1" for the <code>@level</code> attribute means that this is the first level of
        thing within the topic zone (body). Any elements to be nested inside the list item would
        need to specify level "2" (for example, paragraphs for 2nd-level list items).</p>

      <p class="p">The implication of <code>@containerType</code> is that all adjacent Word paragraphs with
        the same container type will be output into a single instance of the specified container.
        This is how you can get a sequence of ListBullet paragraphs to output as a single DITA
          <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element.</p>

      <p class="p">This pattern of <code>@tagName</code> and <code>@containerType</code> can be used for
        any paragraphs that need to be output inside a common container that are not creating DITA
          <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> elements (which have special mapping support).</p>

    </div>

  </div>

  <div class="topic concept nested1" id="mapping-dl">
    <h2 class="title topictitle2">Mapping Definition Lists</h2>

    <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">Definition lists are a challenge because there is no single Word structure that maps
        directly to definition lists and DITA requires two-levels of containment: one for the
        definition list as a whole and one for each term/definition pair. To model definition lists
        you must use pairs of paragraphs: one for the definition term and one for the definition
        description. </p>

      <p class="p">Definition term paragraphs use the <code>@structureType</code> value "dt" and definition
        description paragraphs use the <code>@structureType</code> value "dd". For a pair of
        paragraph styles that represent a term/definition pair, they both specify the same value for
        the <code>@dlEntryType</code> attribute, e,g., "dlentry". Finally, they both specify the
        same value for the <code>@containerType</code> attribute, which specifies the overall
        definition list element, e.g. "dl".</p>

      <div class="p">Thus, given two paragraph styles "Def Term" and "Def Desc" you would define these mappings
        to generate a normal DITA definition
        list:<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;paragraphStyle styleName="Def Term"
  structureType="dt"
  tagName="dt"
  dlEntryType="dlentry"
  containerType="dl"
  topicZone="body"
/&gt;
&lt;paragraphStyle styleName="Def Desc"
  structureType="dd"
  tagName="dd"
  dlEntryType="dlentry"
  containerType="dl"
  topicZone="body"
/&gt;</pre>
</div>

      <p class="p">Note that the resulting markup doesn't have to be a specialization of <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code>
        it just has to have the same structural pattern of two levels of containment with the
        lowest-level elements in common containers. You could use this mapping pattern to generate
        simple tables, for example.</p>

    </div>

  </div>

  <div class="topic concept nested1" id="mapping-procedures">
    <h2 class="title topictitle2">Mapping Procedure Steps</h2>

    <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">Steps in procedures are similar to definition lists in that there are two layers of markup
        that wrap the paragraphs for a step: the <code>&lt;steps&gt;</code> element that contains each
          <code>&lt;step&gt;</code> and the <code>&lt;cmd&gt;</code> element that is the required first
        subelement of <code>&lt;step&gt;</code>.</p>

      <div class="p">Given a paragraph that is the first or only paragraph of a step, you can map it by treating
        it like a definition list, using a <code>@structureType</code> of
        "dt":<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;paragraphStyle styleName="List 1"
  structureType="dt"
  dlEntryType="step"
  containerType="steps"
  tagName="cmd"
  level="1"
/&gt;</pre>
</div>

      <p class="p">Here the paragraph style "List1" is mapped to <code>&lt;cmd&gt;</code> within
          <code>&lt;step&gt;</code> within <code>&lt;steps&gt;</code>.</p>

      <div class="p">If you have follow-on paragraphs for the step they should go in an <code>&lt;info&gt;</code>
        element. For this case you would use normal mapping and specify level
        2:<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;paragraphStyle styleName="BodyText Step"
  containerType="info"
  tagName="p"
  level="2"
  structureType="block"
  topicZone="body"
/&gt;</pre>
</div>

      <div class="p">If you have list items that need to go in the <code>&lt;info&gt;</code> element then you use
        a definition list mapping like
        so:<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;paragraphStyle styleName="Bullet 2 Step"
  containerType="info"
  dlEntryType="ul"
  tagName="li"
  level="2"
  structureType="dt"
  topicZone="body"
/&gt;</pre>
</div>

      <p class="p">Because the container type for both BodyText Step and Bullet 2 Step is "info" in this
        example both paragraph types will end up contributing to the same info element in the output
        if they occur together.</p>

    </div>

  </div>

  <div class="topic concept nested1" id="mapping-tables">
    <h2 class="title topictitle2">Mapping Tables</h2>

    <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">Word tables are automatically converted to DITA tables. Paragraph and character styles
        within table cells will be mapped as defined in the mapping but you don't have direct
        control over how the table elements map to DITA markup (but you can always post-process the
        initial DITA into whatever you want).</p>

      <p class="p">The transform captures as much detail from the Word table as can be expressed using DITA
        tables, including the precise table geometry, row and column spans, row and cell borders,
        and horizontal and vertical cell alignment.</p>

    </div>

  </div>

  <div class="topic concept nested1" id="skipping-paras">
    <h2 class="title topictitle2">Skipping Paragraphs</h2>

    <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">It's often useful or necessary to have paragraphs in the Word document that shouldn't be
        reflected in the DITA output. For this case you can use a <code>@structureType</code> of
        "skip". Paragraphs with a structure type of "skip" are ignored and have no effect on output.
        In particular, they do not affect the determination of what paragraphs are adjacent for
          <code>@containerType</code> processing.</p>

      <p class="p">In addition to explicitly-skipped paragraphs, paragraphs that are not otherwise mapped and
        that have empty content (that is, they normalize to a single blank or to the empty string)
        are automatically skipped. This saves you having worry about users creating empty paragraphs
        to get vertical spacing in Word documents.</p>

    </div>

  </div>

  <div class="topic concept nested1" id="mapping-to-sections">
    <h2 class="title topictitle2">Mapping to Sections</h2>

    <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">DITA sections are challenging because they have three ways to represent the title: a
        literal title child element, an explicit <code>@spectitle</code> attribute, or a
          <code>@spectitle</code> set in the document type and not intended to be set by authors.
        In addition, some topic types require the use of sections within the topic body. This all
        leads to a bit of complexity.</p>

      <div class="p">The simplest case is where a paragraph acts as the title of section and should result in a
        section where the paragraph is section title and the subsequent paragraphs are within the
        section. For this you specify a <code>@structureType</code> of section and a
          <code>@tagName</code> of "title" (or whatever the section title element should be, but
        usually
        "title"):<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;paragraphStyle styleName="My Section Title"
  structureType="section"
  tagName="title"
  sectionType="section"
  topicZone="body"
  useAsTitle="yes"
/&gt;</pre>
</div>

      <p class="p">Note that you don't have to worry about the <code>@level</code> attribute with sections
        because DITA sections cannot nest and must be direct children of the topic body. So the
        conversion processing will always do the right thing for sections.</p>

      <p class="p">Note, however, that if you have any sections within your topic body then all the paragraphs
        that follow the first section-creating paragraph will be in a section because there's no way
        to indicate that a given paragraph should not be in a section. However, this shouldn't be a
        problem in practice because it would be a very rare markup design that expected there to be
        a random mix of section elements and non-section elements within the topic body.</p>

      <p class="p">Any paragraphs that precede the first section-creating paragraph within a topic body will
        be direct children of the topic body <em class="ph i">unless</em> you specify the
          <code>@initialSectionType</code> attribute for the paragraph that generates the
        containing topic. </p>

      <p class="p">For example, the Learning and Training learningContent topic type requires the use of
        section-type elements within the topic body. To handle this case you can specify the
          <code>@initialSectionType</code> attribute to indicate that the initial paragraphs of
        the topic body should be wrapped in a section.</p>

      <div class="p">For example, given a paragraph style "Lesson Title" that maps to a learningContent topic, you would define a mapping like this:<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;paragraphStyle styleName="Lesson Title" 
    <strong class="ph b">structureType="topicTitle"</strong> 
    level="1"&gt;
  &lt;topicProperties initialSectionType="lcIntro"
      topicType="learningContent"
      bodyType="learningContentbody"
  /&gt;
&lt;/paragraphStyle&gt;</pre>
</div>

      <div class="p">This will result in markup like
        this:<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;learningContent id="topicid"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Learning Content&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;shortdesc&gt;Put a shortdesc of one or two sentences here.&lt;/shortdesc&gt;
  &lt;learningContentbody&gt;
    &lt;lcIntro&gt;
       ... (paragraphs go here)      
    &lt;/lcIntro&gt;
  &lt;/learningContentbody&gt;
&lt;/learningContent&gt;</pre>
</div>

      <p class="p">All paragraphs up to the first paragraph that maps to section would go within the
          <code>&lt;lcIntro&gt;</code> element in this example.</p>

      <div class="p">In some cases paragraphs should map to a section, provide the title or spectitle, and then
        be the first paragraph of the section. For example, a paragraph like
        this:<pre class="pre codeblock">Usage: Controls the construction of the section title.</pre>
</div>

      <p class="p">Could provide the spec title of "Usage" and the initial paragraph of "Controls the
        construction of the section title.".</p>

      <div class="p">You can do this by indicating that the paragraph is not the section title and that the
        spectitle is the text up to the first
        colon:<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;paragraphStyle styleName="My Section"
  structureType="section"
  tagName="p"
  topicZone="body"
  spectitle="#toColon"
/&gt;</pre>
</div>

      <p class="p">Here the keyword value "#toColon" for the <code>@spectitle</code> attribute indicates
        that the spectitle value should be taken from the paragraph content up to, but not
        including, the first colon. (Other values could be implemented but as of version 0.9.6 the
        only implemented value is "#toColon".) The value "p" for the <code>@tagName</code>
        attribute indicates that the paragraph will be the first paragraph of the section rather
        than the title.</p>

      <p class="p">You can also specify a literal value for <code>@spectitle</code>, which simply becomes
        the value of the <code>@spectitle</code> attribute in the generated DITA XML.</p>

  <div class="topic concept nested1" id="mapping-to-maps">
    <h2 class="title topictitle2">Mapping to Maps and Map Components (Topicrefs)</h2>

    <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">The simplest mapping is one in which a single Word document maps to a single result topic
        document. However, you can generate systems of maps in addition to topics from a single
        input Word file. However, this gets a little complex because there's a lot going on.</p>

      <p class="p">When you are generating a map and topics you must map the first non-skipped paragraph in
        the Word document to a map element, which will generate the root map of the output
        structure. It can also map to a topic (and by implication, a topicref to that topic) but it
        need not.</p>

      <div class="p">For example, if your first paragraph has the style "Publication Title" and you want to
        generate a bookmap map but not a topic you would use this
        mapping:<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;paragraphStyle styleName="Title"
  level="0"
  structureType="mapTitle"
  tagName="title"&gt;
   &lt;mapProperties tagName="title" format="bookmap" prologType="topicmeta"/&gt;
&lt;/paragraphStyle&gt;</pre>
</div>

      <p class="p">The <code>@structureType</code> value of "mapTitle" triggers the general map generation.
        The other attributes define the details of the map markup: <code>@mapType</code> and
          <code>@prologType</code>. The value "0" (zero) for the <code>@level</code> attribute
        indicates that this is the root output structure. You should only have one level-zero
        paragraph-to-map or paragraph-to-topic mapping.</p>

      <p class="p">If you map a paragraph to a structure type of "mapTitle" at a level other than zero then
        you will create a submap that is referenced from the parent map (that is, the map that is
        one level up in the mapping hierarchy). In this case you must specify the
          <code>@maprefType</code> attribute in order to get a topicref generated in the parent
        map.</p>

      <div class="p">When a paragraph maps to a map and a topic you specify a structure type of "mapTitle" and
        specify the topic type using the <code>@secondStructureType</code> attribute. You can
        then specify the other attributes used to generate a result topic as you would for a
        structure type of
        "mapTitle":<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;paragraphStyle styleName="Topic Title"
     level="1"
     secondStructureType="topicTitle"
     structureType="mapTitle"
     tagName="title"&gt;
   &lt;mapProperties 
       format="learningContent" 
       prologType="prolog" tagName="title"
   /&gt;
   &lt;topicrefProperties 
       chunk="to-content" 
       topicrefType="learningContentRef"
   /&gt;
   &lt;topicProperties 
       bodyType="learningContentbody"
       initialSectionType="section"
       topicDoc="yes"
       topicType="learningContent"
   /&gt;
&lt;/paragraphStyle&gt;</pre>
</div>

      <p class="p">This example maps a paragraph named "Topic Title" to a generic map
          (<code>@mapType</code> of "map") and a learningContent topic referenced from the map.
        The value of "1" for the <code>@level</code> attribute means this map will be a submap to
        the root map.</p>

      <p class="p">There are attributes for specifying the element types for each different kind of element
        that might result from generating both a map and topic.</p>

      <p class="p">When a new document should be referenced from the current map simply specify the
          <code>@topicrefType</code> attribute and a structure type of "topicTitle".</p>

    </div>

  </div>

  <div class="topic concept nested1" id="mapping-metadata">
    <h2 class="title topictitle2">Mapping Metadata</h2>

    <div class="body conbody">
      <div class="p">To map paragraphs to <code>&lt;data&gt;</code> elements within the root topic prolog, you
        must specify:<ul class="ul" id="mapping-metadata__ul_egh_k3v_3h">
          <li class="li"><code>@topicZone</code> as "prolog"</li>

          <li class="li"><code>@baseClass</code> as "- topic/data " (note the trailing blank) </li>

          <li class="li"><code>@containingTopic</code> as "root" </li>

          <li class="li"><code>@level</code> as "0"</li>

        </ul>
</div>

      <p class="p">To map to unspecialized <code>&lt;data&gt;</code> you would specify <code>@tagName</code>
        as "data". You can put the paragraph content either into the content of the
          <code>&lt;data&gt;</code> element or into the <code>@value</code> attribute. To put it in
        content, set <code>@putValueIn</code> to "content", otherwise set it to "value".</p>

      <p class="p">Because the DITA content model for <code>&lt;prolog&gt;</code> is a bit fiddly, with a
        required sequence of element types, you may need to apply post-processing in the
        "final-fixup" mode to make sure the resulting prolog content is valid.</p>

  <div class="topic concept nested1" id="mapping-sidebars">
    <h2 class="title topictitle2">Mapping Sidebars</h2>

    <div class="body conbody">
      <p class="p">Sidebars are a particular problematic element because they often have no fixed location in
        the overall hierarchy. That is, they are often allowed (by publishers' business rules) to
        occur at many different levels (perhaps inside Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3, and Heading
        4 sections). This used to require specific Word styles for each hierarchical level that the
        sidebar could appear at (e.g., Sidebar Title in Heading 1, Sidebar Title in Heading 2). That
        increased work and potential for error for maintainers of the style-to-tag mapping (because
        they had to make sure they had appropriate definitions for each level a sidebar was allowed
        at) and for authors (because they had to use the right sidebar style for whatever level the
        sidebar was to appear at. These obstacles have been overcome starting in 0.9.19 RC 11.</p>

      <p class="p">FIXME: Rewrite to reflect new relative level values.</p>

      <p class="p">With 0.9.19 RC 11, there is further processing that recalculates the level for individual
        instances of topic-generating styles. Because the recalculation respects the relationships
        between levels as established in the style-to-tag mapping, authors can place sidebars where
        they want and mapping maintainers only need a single sidebar title style definition
        (assuming they set the relationships correctly). The easiest (perhaps best) way to set the
        level for sidebars is to give them a really deep level, such as 50. In the recalculation,
        each instance of the sidebar title will be assigned a level that nests the sidebar within
        the parent topic.</p>

      <div class="p">For example, to map the paragraph "Sidebar Title" to a sidebar topic you would use this
        mapping:<pre class="pre codeblock">&lt;paragraphStyle styleName="Sidebar Title"
    structureType="topicTitle"
    tagName="title"
    level="50"&gt;
   &lt;topicProperties topicType="sidebar" bodyType="body" prologType="prolog"/&gt;
&lt;/paragraphStyle&gt;</pre>
